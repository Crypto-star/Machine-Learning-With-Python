# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation explains the code that trains and uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to make predictions. The code is designed to work with a dataset named "churn_df.csv" and uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning.

## Code Overview
The code is split into two main sections: Training The Model and Predicting The Model.

### Training The Model
In this section, we prepare the dataset and train a KNN classifier to predict a binary target variable ("churn") based on two features: "account_length" and "customer_service_calls." Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:

1. Import Necessary Libraries:
   - We start by importing the required libraries:
     - `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier` for KNN classifier.
     - `pandas` for data manipulation.

2. Load the Dataset:
   - We load the dataset named "churn_df.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called "churn_df."

3. Data Preparation:
   - We extract the feature variables (X) and the target variable (y) from the dataset. In this case, "account_length" and "customer_service_calls" are used as features, and "churn" is the target variable.

4. Initialize the KNN Classifier:
   - We create an instance of the KNN classifier with a parameter `n_neighbors` set to 6. This parameter defines the number of neighbors to consider when making predictions.

5. Train the Model:
   - We train the KNN model by calling the `fit` method on the KNN classifier with the feature variables (X) and the target variable (y).

### Predicting The Model
In this section, we use the trained KNN classifier to make predictions on new data points. We define three new data points in the variable "X_new" and predict the corresponding "churn" values. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Define New Data Points:
   - We create a list "X_new" that contains three new data points, each represented as a list of feature values. For example, the first data point has an "account_length" of 30.0 and "customer_service_calls" of 17.5.

2. Make Predictions:
   - We use the trained KNN classifier, "knn," to predict the "churn" values for the new data points. The `predict` method is called on "knn" with "X_new" as the input.

3. Display Predictions:
   - Finally, we print the predictions in the format "Predictions: [prediction1, prediction2, prediction3]." These predictions represent the "churn" values for the new data points.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required libraries, especially scikit-learn and pandas, installed in your Python environment.

2. Place the "churn_df.csv" dataset in the same directory as the code or provide the correct path to the dataset in the code.

3. Run the code to train the KNN model and make predictions on new data points.

4. Review the predictions in the output, which will indicate whether the new data points are likely to result in churn.
